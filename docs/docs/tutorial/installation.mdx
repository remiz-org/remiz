# Installation

**Remiz** is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. You can download the latest
version of the binary from the [Github Release page](https://github.com/remiz-org/remiz/releases/latest)


## Extract the binary from the archive

On the release page, you'll find the link to an archive. For example, for Linux,
you may want to choose the .tar.gz download option and may want to execute
the following command :

```
wget https://github.com/remiz-org/remiz/releases/download/v0.0.23/remiz_v0.0.23_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
tar -xf remiz_v0.0.23_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
```


## Choose a location for the binary

Once the binary extracted, you may want to choose a final location for installation.
On Linux, many users will place the binary inside the `/usr/local/bin` since
it's contained in the `$PATH`, thus making the `remiz` command available everywhere.
You could also make a symbolic link to the binary from this folder :

```
ln -s ~/remiz/remiz /usr/local/bin/remiz
```

This is the **prefered** way to set up remiz properly since you will need
to write the configuration where the binary resides.

## Test your installation

If everything is set up, you will be able to execute the `remiz` command.
