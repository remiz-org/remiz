# Deploying package

This page describes the deploying process and how to deploy your first package.

## Deployment process

## Deploy command

## Verify your deployment

After you have deployed your first package, it's highly recommended to check that all parts of your project have been deployed accordingly to your rules.

:::tip Tip

A great way to verify this is to make a backup of your project. Build the package for it. Delete your project. Deploy the package. Rebuild the package from this newly deployed project, and check that the `remiz diff` command returns nothing.
