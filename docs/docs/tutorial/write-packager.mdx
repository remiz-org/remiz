# Write your own packager

## Objectives
A packager lets you organize your project by components.
Each packager is responsible for saving all assets (when building a package)
and how to deploy them.

For example, if you want to bundle and deploy a dynamic web site, you could write
a packager responsible for the backend logic (Python scripts e.g),
another packager for the frontend part (in Javascript) and another one for
your database (like .sql dump).

A packager could be written in any language, as long as the file(s) could be executed.

## Implement a simple packager

Implemeting a packager is very straightforward. It consists of 2 main steps :
- write the logic needed to build the package
- write the logic needed to deploy the package

All the necessary informations needed for your packager are passed by argument.

For example, a good starting in Python could be :

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import argparse

def get_args():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='copy_files packager.')

    subparser = parser.add_subparsers(dest="subcommand", required=True)
    build_parser = subparser.add_parser("build")
    build_parser.add_argument('--path', required=True)

    deploy_parser = subparser.add_parser("deploy")
    deploy_parser.add_argument('--path', required=True)
    deploy_parser.add_argument('--env', required=True)

    return parser.parse_known_args()
...
if __name__ == "__main__":
    args, unknown_args = get_args()

    if args.subcommand == "build":
        build(args.path, unknown_args)

    if args.subcommand == "deploy":
        deploy(args.path, unknown_args, args.env)

```

All you to do is implement `build` and `deploy` functions.

## Declare packager
Before using a packager, you must declare it to Remiz via the global
configuration file.

For example, if you want to register a 'foo' packager pointing to a Python
script, add it to the `[packagers]` section :
```toml
foo = "path/to/foo/main.py"
```

## Use it in your package configuration files
Once declared, you could use it in all packages configuration file that need it.

Simply add a section named after your packager, and add all entries required
by your packager :

```toml
[foo]
test_1 = "./src/test_1.sh"
test_2 = "./src/test_2.py"
test_3 = [
    "./data/1.csv",
    "./data/2.csv",
    "./data/3.csv",
]
```

:::tip Tip

When testing a packager, a good practice is to use the `unpack` subcommand of
Remiz and see if any files is missing.
