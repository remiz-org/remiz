# Building package
This page describes the building process and how to build your first package.

## Build process
For each packager declared in your package configuration, Remiz will
sequentially call your packager entrypoints (as defined in the global
configuration). For each packager, Remiz will gather files from the
magic folder. Remiz can register 0, 1 or multiples files from the same packager
but a warning will be triggered if no file is found.

:::caution Caution

If a packager exits with a non-zero exit code, Remiz will stop the build process.

:::


After all packagers have finished, Remiz will produce the final package
including all the packagers files plus metadata.



## Build command
To start the build process, simply call the 'build' subcommand :

`remiz build path/to/package_config.toml`

You could also include the location of the global configuration file to use
and pass extra arguments to the packagers :

`remiz build path/to/package_config.toml -g path/to/global_config.toml -- --extra args`

## Verify your .pack package
Once your package is successfully built, you have to inspect it first before
considering your pipeline stable.

You could use the `unpack` command for this purpose.
