# Configuration globale

The global configuration file is required for Remiz to work.
You can specify the location of the file using the -g/--global_config_file command flag. If not specified, Remiz will look for the configuration file to be put in the same directory as the binary.

A configuration file includes at 2 sections:

- all **packagers** to use when building/deploying
- all **stores** in each you want to store/deploy from the artifact file.

## Create your first global configuration

Create a toml file at where the binary is located, for example `remiz/configuration.toml`:

```md title="configuration.toml"
[packagers]
copy_files = "packagers/copy_files.py"

[store]
local = "packages/{name}/{name}_v{version}.pack"
```

You will find an explanation for each line of the file below.


## Packagers section
In this section, each value represents a packager. A Packager is a script or program
that is in charge of copying files of your project in a 'magic' folder (when building)
and also in charge of deploying the files when deploying.

In this example, `copy_files` is the name of the packager. You can name it as you like
but you should keep in mind that you will have to use this name in the package configuration
(next page).

The value of this attribute must be the path to the packager.

:::tip Tip

You should use the shebang syntax at the top of any packager that is interpreted.
For example, in Python, the first line may be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.

## Store section

The `[store]` section defines all the locations where your package will be
stored. It may be a local or a remote file system (via SFTP, ...).
For now, only local storage is supported.
In this example, `local = "packages/{name}/{name}_v{version}.pack"` will store
all packages in `packages/{name}/{name}_v{version}.pack` path with all
variables relative to the project substitued. For example, if the package name
is 'foo' and version is '1.0.0', the final path will be
`packages/foo/foo_v1.0.0.pack`.
`{name}` and `{version}` are defined in the package configuration file.
